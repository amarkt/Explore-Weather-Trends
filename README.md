# Explore-Weather-Trends

I'm Amar, from India. I'm passionate about Data Analysis and Visualization and aspire to become a Data Analyst/.

In this project, I have analysed local temperature of New Delhi city, in accordance with the global temperature data and compared. I had been provided with a database on Udacity portal from which, I have to extracte, manipulate and visualize the data to compare treds over a certain period of time.
