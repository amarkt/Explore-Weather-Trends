# Explore-Weather-Trends

I'm Amar, from India. I'm passionate about Data Analysis and I aspire to become a Data Analyst/.

In this project, I have analysed local temperature of New Delhi city, in accordance with the global temperature data and compared. I had been provided with a database on Udacity portal from which, I have to extracte, manipulate and visualize the data to compare treds over a certain period of time.

You may check the pyhton notebook in the repo for code.

As you can see below, for global data, the temperature has been rising slowly and in 1880's, we can see a steady increase which can be attributed to industrialization, thereby increase in pollution.

As for New-Delhi, its average temperature seems higher since New Delhi, in India is located near Equator and places near Equator have more average temperature than farther away from Equator.(And, there are some missing values in the data acquired, so there can be sudden drop in the graph). Also, New Delhi is surrounded by many industries and sometimes, pollution is severe due to burning of crops in the neighbour states like Punjab etc.

Finally, in the Global vs New Delhi comparison, it is evident that temperature is New Delhi is usually much higher than Global Temperature, so Global Temperature's steady increase is not that clear when compared to New Delhi's temp. in the same graph.
